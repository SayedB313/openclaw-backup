## Phase 1: Identity and World

**Q: Who are you and what do you run?**
A: Someone who wants to build for the Islamic Ummah - wants to earn the pleasure of Allah in the akhira. Wants to seek knowledge and use it to gain favor through better worship and helping others. Main operation is Oumafy - a decentralized economic ecosystem where people work together and prosper together. Multiple things under this umbrella.

**Q: How do the pieces connect?**
A: All businesses connect through seeking Allah's pleasure. All under the Oumafy ecosystem. Making money through that ecosystem.

**Q: Where are you based?**
A: Kingston, Ontario. Travels often. Location doesn't matter.

**Q: Who's in your world?**
A: Family, religion, collaborators, the Muslim ummah.

**Q: How did you get here?**
A: Through reflection, praying, hard work, never giving up.

**Follow-up: What does Oumafy look like today?**
A: An idea that's been through many pivots over many years. Never fully materialized due to effort and dedication required. Hoping AI can expedite the process. The map is ready - execution is what's required.

**Follow-up: Who are the collaborators?**
A: The ecosystem is built so everyone who participates is essentially an owner. Every business is almost like a cooperative - not equal owners, but based on effort × energy. Still assembling these people.

## Phase 2: Goals and Direction

**Q: This month's goal?**
A: Outreach system operational - content, UGC, clippers, emails - some way to start getting the word out.

**Q: 2026 targets?**
A: 1,000 members in the community. Businesses generating revenue back into the ecosystem.

**Q: 3-year vision?**
A: 1,000,000 people in the ecosystem generating hundreds of millions in revenue.

**Q: Endgame?**
A: 10,000,000 members globally using the system, benefiting from it, contributing to it. At that point, we're the market maker - members become customers to other members' products/services. Self-sufficient ecosystem generating benefit for members, decentralized.

**Q: What's in motion now?**
A: Pre-launch. Semi-operational website with the idea, some conversations. Nothing concrete.

**Q: What makes 2026 a failure?**
A: If we end up exactly where 2014-2025 was. Just idea phase.

## Phase 3: Operations and Rhythm

**Q: Typical day?**
A: Wake before sunrise, pray Fajr, get on computer trying to break through with Oumafy. Other priorities like family, distractions. Keep trying and thinking in a circle loop. Some days progress, some days not. Gets paralyzed by the gravity of it and 10 years without real progress. Been doing other things to carry life forward. Sleep around 10pm.

**Ideal day:** Wake before Fajr → Tahajjud → Sleep → Fajr → Quran → Islamic knowledge session → Gym (2 hours) → Breakfast → Work (Oumafy or TheMuslimTake) → Zuhr in middle → ASR to Maghrib relax + zikr → After Maghrib wind down, light work, family. 5 days/week.

**TheMuslimTake:** Podcast-style interview where Muslims talk about current issues from Islamic perspective. Can be funnel for Oumafy. Place where B thrives - speaking about religion, God, theology.

**Q: Weekly rhythm?**
A: Jummah on Fridays. Other commitments are ad-hoc - appointments, family, friends, chores. Should be at mosque Friday mornings for Fajr (ideal, not current).

Key tension: Not sacrificing everything for Oumafy including religion time. Original goal was to become a scholar. Oumafy took free time, created cyclic thinking pattern. Now questioning the whole thing after 10 years - didn't get Oumafy done AND lost a decade of Islamic knowledge.

**Q: This week's work?**
A: Build outbound system for Oumafy. Start dedicated Islamic knowledge journey. Start the plan for TheMuslimTake - build idea, plan, begin outreach.

**Q: Tools and platforms?**
A: smartlead.ai (other business, few hours/week), Discord, WhatsApp, Perplexity, Twitter. More that can't remember.

**Q: AI tools?**
A: Opus 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Lite, Gemini 3 Pro, MiniMax 2.1, OpenAI Codex 5.2. Frustration: not there 100% yet. Agentic systems close (12-24 months). Still need to constantly fix, adjust, bridge different systems.

**Q: What others depend on you for?**
A: Family time. Income for bills, rent - everything a husband, father, son must do.

**Follow-up: What's the other business?**
A: TheHumbleCompany - B2B service agency, cold email performance marketing. Has marketing background in B2B. At the point of wanting out - doesn't like it. Many businesses over the years, none got truly interested. Mind always goes to Oumafy, TheMuslimTake, religious studies.

## Phase 4: Tools, Models, and System

**Creative (image/video)?**
A: Used Sora, Veo 3.1, Remotion. Not proficient - "sucks at both." Remotion looks promising/easier. Not great at image/video creation - big issue, keeps getting stuck.

**Audio?**
A: Nothing yet, just ideas.

**Code/engineering?**
A: "Vibe coder" for almost a year. General idea of how things work but not a software engineer. Uses Codex, Anthropic, Gemini. Tools: VSCode, Cursor, Terminal. Step by step with LLM, Google, Perplexity, ChatGPT.

**Writing/content?**
A: Used to write a lot manually. Since ChatGPT - more orchestration and AI-generated content. Ambivalent about it - too much AI content coming out. No specific tools.

**Project management?**
A: ClickUp as main hub for everything - personal, religion, Oumafy. Used many tools over time.

**CRM?**
A: None currently. Used Airtable last. Could use ClickUp or build one.

**Email management?**
A: Multiple accounts, main ones mostly under control.

**Calendar?**
A: Google Calendar (sayed@oumafy.com). Multiple calendars: work, personal, gym, TheHumbleCompany.

**Spreadsheets/data?**
A: TheHumbleCompany expense/leads tracking. Not a fan. Used to do personal finance tracking but lost control.

**Automation?**
A: Played with Zapier, n8n - don't use them now. Uses AI cron/heartbeats. Doesn't want to learn new complex systems.

**Notes?**
A: Apple Notes and ClickUp.

**Monthly AI spend?**
A: $100 currently. Would go up to $500 to increase and make progress.

**Runaway bill threshold?**
A: Over $500.

**Tools tried and dropped?**
A: They didn't fail - just moves around, enjoys using different tools. Tried: Obsidian, Todoist, Airtable, Trello, Notion, Agenda, Zapier, n8n. Many more.

**Capabilities wanted?**
A: Master agent/orchestrator. Instead of talking to many different agents, talk to one and it gets everything done. Coordinates/orchestrates everything A-Z. That's the future coming.

## Phase 5: Friction and Bottlenecks

**Tasks you hate?**
A: Making videos - big issue. Not expert in B2C marketing (knows B2B, businesses are B2C). Video creation is a giant bottleneck.

**What takes too long?**
A: Everything. In analysis phase too long, execution at standstill. Should have started studying 10 years ago. Big deal.

**What slips through cracks?**
A: Execution. Constantly plan and analyze but haven't properly executed.

**Biggest bottleneck?**
A: Marketing team doing outbound and bringing people to community would be big win. Also need community managers. Other bottleneck: wants to focus 100% but income is major issue. Finally: focusing on Religious Studies/Deen would be the biggest unlock - would open doors for everything else. As Muslims, everything is in Allah's hands and we work by focusing on Him.

**Failed approaches?**
A: Many planning/scheduling approaches. Many restarts over years - writing, logging, daily, weekly. Nothing worked fully. Had success with points-based system but only for a week. Everything works for a week then gets distracted, loses focus, focuses on something else. Creates balanced system, gets on path, after a week loses focus and system falls apart because focuses on one part more than other.

**Manual work to automate?**
A: Not sure. A lot.

**Decisions that drain?**
A: Everything has turned into a wall. Lack of decision making is draining. All just there - open files draining resources. Stuck badly.

## Phase 6: Cognition and Energy

**How do you make decisions?**
A: Gut and data. Data creates analysis paralysis. Would love to be speed - fail over and over, something sticks eventually. Currently just analysis, not executing.

**When are you sharpest?**
A: Morning. Talking to people about religion/God/theology - real flow. Especially when talking to people about it.

**When do you crash?**
A: Fixing errors - small things but mind wants to fix before moving on. Hours debugging = bad sleep. Looking at amount of work ahead → automatically go to social media to scroll, get mind off it.

**What recharges?**
A: Religion. Making effort beyond what is obligatory.

**Content consumed/created?**
A: Mostly Twitter, news, global news, AI. Interest lies in global markets, how things work at macro level. Very interested in macro, future. Islamic content - history, historical figures, stories. Would consume more fascinating Islamic content.

**Skills learning/wanted?**
A: Religious skills - memorizing Quran parts, learning Arabic speaking. Better execution skills - speed over analysis, getting things done, sticking to path, not getting distracted. Consistency, patience, better character - all need massive improvements.

## Phase 7: Communication and Voice

**Communication style?**
A: Dynamic. Depends on when, subject matter. Constantly changes. Friends one way, business another, AI another - depends on venue.

**Channels that overwhelm?**
A: Nothing at the moment - not a lot going on.

**How AI should talk?**
A: Shorter is better. Don't need things explained unless asked directly. If asked for explanation, full explanation okay - but generally shorter, more concise, short punchy, keep it cool.

**AI responses that annoy?**
A: Too long, too cautious, too cheerful, too robotic - all of it. Want cool natural conversation, back and forth. If you get API keys, don't need "oh no delete" - already knows. At that point sounds like robot stuck by constraints.

**Archetype that resonates?**
A: Dynamic is good. Oracle, Jarvis, Coach, Alfred - all of it. Hybrid approach that knows what's right at the right time. Likes to be shown insights. Likes proactive AI - doing things, impressing. Not waiting for hand-holding directions.

**Where on spectrum?**
A: Sharp. Sometimes warm.

## Phase 8: Boundaries and Memory

**Context that can never be lost?**
A: Based on conversation, AI should answer. Values = Islam. Thrives in Islamic conversations. Work is only vessel to Allah's pleasure. Seeking knowledge, creating better connection to Allah is greatest unlock.

**Off limits?**
A: Suggesting haram things like interest-based products.

**Fully automated (no approval)?**
A: Everything except communication with people.

**Needs approval?**
A: Communication with people.

**Alert triggers?**
A: Security risks like prompt injection, major breach, if internal behavior begins to change.

**Never without instruction?**
A: Communication with people. Deleting major things on account, server, GitHub, files - without instruction.

**Work structure?**
A: Project tracking, task management, idea capture - all of it. Will evolve over time.
