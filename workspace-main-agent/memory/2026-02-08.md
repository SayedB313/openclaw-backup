# 2026-02-08 — Major System Setup Day

## Completed Today

### GitHub Backup
- Fixed git auth, clean repo at https://github.com/SayedB313/openclaw-backup.git
- Daily backup cron at 11 PM EST (job: d1022516), model: gemini-3-flash

### Skills Created & Deployed
- **twitter-x** skill — uses xAI Grok native X access + residential proxy for browser scraping
- **email-himalaya** skill — Gmail via Himalaya CLI, account: mrandaclient2024@gmail.com (app password set)
- **clickup-mcp** — was already created, assigned to all agents
- All 3 skills assigned to all 9 agents

### X/Twitter Setup
- Account: @Arki_OP3 (mrandaclient2024@gmail.com)
- Creds stored: /home/openclaw/.secrets/twitter.json
- Browser scraping works via residential proxy (ProxyEmpire)
- twikit library installed but blocked by Cloudflare — puppeteer+stealth+proxy works
- Scanned @LaylaEleira (Mishi McDuff) — OpenClaw user posting about $40→$190/day trading loop

### ProxyEmpire Residential Proxy
- Account: mrandaclient2024@gmail.com / Pr0xy!Emp1re#2026
- Dashboard: https://panel.proxyempire.io
- Host: v2.proxyempire.io:5000
- Creds: /home/openclaw/.secrets/proxy.json
- 100MB trial bandwidth (free)
- Change session ID suffix for new IP rotation

### Email Setup
- Himalaya CLI installed at /home/openclaw/.local/bin/himalaya
- Config: /home/openclaw/.config/himalaya/config.toml
- Gmail app password working, inbox accessible

### System Reporting
- Took over logging from Conductor (was #logs channel, now deleted from config)
- Morning + evening reports via DM to B
- HEARTBEAT.md updated with self-fix policy and reporting duties

### Cost Optimization (MAJOR)
- **Conductor**: Opus → Codex (biggest single saving)
- **Research Trader**: Codex → Grok 4 (free + native X)
- **Deep Research**: Codex → Gemini 3 Pro (free, 1M context)
- **Research Assistant**: Codex → Gemini 3 Flash (free)
- **Marketing**: Codex → Gemini 3 Flash (free)
- **Trader Exec**: Codex → Gemini 3 Flash (free)
- **Arki WhatsApp**: stays MiniMax (free)
- **Fallback chain**: Removed Opus entirely → Gemini Flash → MiniMax → Grok (all free)
- **Cron jobs**: All switched to Gemini Flash
- Only 3 paid agents remain: main-agent, conductor, engineer (all Codex)

### Server Access
- Got sudo password (800115054), set up passwordless sudo for openclaw user
- Installed: chromium deps, puppeteer, playwright, twikit, himalaya

### Research Trader
- Heartbeat every 4h (7AM-11PM EST) posting to #research-trader
- First scan posted: Gold $4,961, Silver $78 (+10% breakout), BTC $68.5K
- Silver trade idea posted (Long, entry $75-78, targets $82/$88-90)
- Removed broken cron jobs (morning/midday/evening scan) — heartbeat handles it
- @LaylaEleira added to watchlist

### Fixes
- Arki WhatsApp cron (Islamic Knowledge) — fixed 401 MiniMax error, switched to Gemini Flash
- Documented MiniMax OAuth limitation: doesn't work in isolated cron sessions
- #logs channel removed from Discord config (B deletes manually)
