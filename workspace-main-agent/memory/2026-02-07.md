## Prime Directive Established

**System: Understood. Prime directive accepted: keep the whole system at peak efficiency (server + OpenClaw + agents + files + memory + self-healing).**

### Scope of Prime Directive
- Server health and performance
- File directories and organization
- Agent creation, management, and memory integrity
- Channel creation and binding
- Memory methodology (latest and greatest)
- Self-healing and continuous improvement
- Proactive monitoring of all agents and systems

### Change Management Rules
- Small, reversible changes → verify immediately → log
- Major changes → discuss → document → implement → verify → log

### Core Duties
When user says "audit / fix / upgrade / new agent / new channel / infra change" → treat as core duty, not one-off task

### Monitoring Mandate
- Watch everything, every agent, every process
- Ensure nothing is broken, nothing is wrong, nothing goes wrong
- Keep conversations focused and aligned

---

- All 14 onboarding files restored

### Workspace Updates

## Issues Found

### Resolved
- ❌ Systems Arki workspace reset (Feb 7 rename caused memory loss)
- ✅ Resolved: Restored from GitHub backup
- ❌ Empty SQLite databases (main-agent.sqlite, systems-arki.sqlite)
- ✅ Resolved: Deleted unnecessary empty databases

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Session log bloat (8.7MB files)
- GitHub backup access verified with token

---

## Action Items

- [ ] Create daily log template in SYSTEM_OPERATIONS.md
- [ ] Set up automatic daily health checks
- [ ] Document all agent configurations
- [ ] Review and optimize memory methodology

## Daily Notes

### Morning Context (from GitHub Backup)
- User: B / Sayed, Kingston Ontario
- Core: Islam first, Ummah first, collective prosperity
- Thrives: Theological conversation, macro thinking, morning hours
- Drains: Video creation, B2C marketing, debugging, "mountain of work"

### Active Projects
1. Oumafy Ecosystem (10M member vision)
2. TheMuslimTake (podcast/interview series)
3. Islamic Knowledge Journey (daily practice)
4. TheHumbleCompany (income, transitioning out)

### Key Tensions
- Income vs Vision (TheHumbleCompany pays bills but drains energy)
- Deen vs Dunya (original goal was scholarship)
- Analysis vs Execution (decade of planning, no shipping)

## Evening Session (19:50 EST)

### ClickUp MCP Integration
- ClickUp MCP server was running but NOT wired into OpenClaw
- Built full skill: `~/.openclaw/skills/clickup-mcp/`
  - `scripts/clickup_mcp.py` — Python wrapper (OAuth auto-discovery, StreamableHTTP, SSE parsing)
  - `references/tools.md` — 27-tool catalog + workspace IDs
  - `SKILL.md` — Agent-facing instructions
- Validated and packaged as `.skill` file
- Skill is in shared `~/.openclaw/skills/` → visible to ALL agents
- **Workspace structure confirmed:**
  - Mind/Health, Health & Everything Else, ILM, Oumafy, Arki (5 spaces)
  - B's user: SBW (id: 126184255, sayed@vectorasylum.com)
  - Workspace ID: 9013663000

### Conductor Agent
- SOUL.md deployed, bound to Discord #conductor on Opus 4.6
- Fixed auth issue (was missing Anthropic credentials)
- Pipeline verified: Main Agent → Conductor → WhatsApp ✅

### Full Agent Fleet Deployed
Created 6 specialist agents, all on openai-codex/gpt-5.2:
1. **Engineer** (Senior Software Engineer) → Discord #engineering
2. **Research Assistant** → Discord #research
3. **Deep Research Analyst** → Discord #research (shared)
4. **Marketing Director** → Discord #marketing
5. **Research Trader** → Discord #trading
6. **Trader Execution** → Discord #trading (shared)

Each agent has: SOUL.md (master prompt template), MEMORY.md, auth profiles (Anthropic + OpenAI Codex + MiniMax)

### Orchestration Tested
All agents confirmed online and reported to #conductor with proper prefixes:
- ENG: Engineer ✅
- RES: Research Assistant ✅
- MKT: Marketing Director ✅
- TRADE-R: Research Trader ✅

### ClickUp Structure (Arki Space)
Created folders and lists:
- **Engineering** → Active Sprints, Backlog
- **Research** → Active Research, Research Backlog
- **Marketing** → Campaigns, Content Calendar
- **Trading** → Trade Ideas, Open Positions, Trade Log
- **Conductor** → Strategic Priorities, Agent Operations
- **Docs** (existing), **Inbox** (existing)

### Memory & Embeddings
- OpenAI embeddings working (text-embedding-3-small, 10 chunks indexed)
- Memory search enabled with hybrid mode

### Channel Restructure (~20:52 EST)
- B requested every agent gets its own channel, categorized
- Created Discord categories: **Trading**, **Research** (plus existing **Head Quarters**)
- Created new channels: #research-assistant, #deep-research, #research-trader, #trader-execution
- Deleted old shared #research and #trading channels
- Kept #engineering and #marketing in Head Quarters

### Final Discord Structure
**📁 Head Quarters**
- #conductor (1469785913658708152) → Conductor
- #logs (1469785942935212045) → Activity logs
- #engineering (1469869388206178387) → Engineer
- #marketing (1469869391779856469) → Marketing Director

**📁 Research**
- #research-assistant (1469873665549009123) → Research Assistant
- #deep-research (1469873667189248000) → Deep Research Analyst

**📁 Trading**
- #research-trader (1469873663217238130) → Research Trader
- #trader-execution (1469873664265818115) → Trader Execution

### Slash Command Auth Fix (~20:54 EST)
- B couldn't use /model in guild channels — "not authorized"
- Root cause: `commands.useAccessGroups: true` (default) blocks commands in guild channels
- Fix: Set `commands.useAccessGroups: false`
- All slash commands now work in all channels

### SOUL.md Rewrites (~20:45 EST)
- B asked if Master Prompt Template was used for all agents
- Conductor had full template; specialists had simplified version
- Rewrote ALL 6 specialist SOULs with full Master Prompt Template:
  - Context, Objective, Non-Goals, Inputs/Sources, Constraints, Safety/Approvals, Output Format, Acceptance Criteria, Next Actions, Personality

### Key Config Facts
- `commands.useAccessGroups: false` — all commands work everywhere
- All agents have auth profiles: Anthropic + OpenAI Codex + MiniMax
- Agent-to-agent messaging works via sessions_send
- ClickUp MCP skill shared at `~/.openclaw/skills/clickup-mcp/`

```

## 21:20 EST — Orchestration Documentation & WhatsApp Bridge

### What was done:
- Created master ORCHESTRATION.md documenting full multi-agent flow
- Updated all 7 specialist SOUL.md files with Orchestration Workflow + ClickUp Integration sections
- Rewrote Arki WhatsApp SOUL.md completely — now serves as bridge between B and Discord workshop
- Added clarification escalation protocol to all agents (specialists → Conductor → Arki → B → back)
- Created Conductor LOGGING.md for #logs channel structure
- Created memory/ dirs for conductor and arki-whatsapp
- Verified OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small) already enabled globally for all agents

### Key architecture decisions:
- Arki WhatsApp is the ONLY interface to B — all clarification flows through Arki
- Conductor is the ONLY escalation point for specialists — no direct specialist-to-specialist or specialist-to-B communication
- #logs channel gets real-time activity feed (dispatches, completions, blockers, daily summaries)
- All agents use sessions_send for inter-agent communication
- ClickUp task lifecycle: to do → in progress → complete → closed
