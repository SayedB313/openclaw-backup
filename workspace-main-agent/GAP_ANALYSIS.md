## Domains With No AI Model Assigned

| Domain | Current State | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Video creation | Tried Sora, Veo, Remotion — not proficient | Consider delegation or AI-assisted templates |
| Image creation | Weak spot | Need consistent tool + practice OR delegation |
| Audio/podcasting | Nothing yet | For TheMuslimTake: Descript, Riverside, or similar |
| CRM | None (was Airtable) | ClickUp can handle this, or build simple system |
| Personal finance | Lapsed | Re-enable spreadsheet tracking or automate |

## Tasks Done Manually That Could Be Automated

| Task | Current State | Automation Path |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Content ideation | In head | AI prompt: "Give me 10 content ideas for Oumafy based on current Islamic discourse" |
| Guest outreach | Not started | Template + AI personalization + approval flow |
| Social media posting | Manual | Buffer, Typefully, or AI scheduling |
| Email follow-ups | Manual via smartlead | Already semi-automated, extend to Oumafy |
| Progress tracking | ClickUp manual | AI daily summary generation |
| Islamic study scheduling | Not happening | Daily prompt/reminder via OpenClaw cron |

## Capabilities Wanted But Not Found

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Master orchestrator | Wanted | One agent that coordinates everything A-Z |
| True agentic execution | Waiting | "Go do this" and it just does it. 12-24 months out. |
| Video creation without skill | Gap | Either learn or delegate |
| B2C marketing intuition | Gap | Need learning or partnership |

| ElevenLabs | Voice for TheMuslimTake | Podcast intros, content | ~$5-20/month |
| Midjourney / DALL-E 3 | Image generation | Thumbnails, visuals | ~$10-30/month |
| HeyGen or Synthesia | AI video | If delegation not viable | ~$30-100/month |

## Skill Gaps to Address

| Skill | Priority | Path |
|-------|----------|------|
| B2C marketing | High | Learn basics OR partner with B2C marketer |
| Video editing | Medium | Learn Remotion OR hire editor |
| Arabic (speaking) | High (personal) | Structured learning program |
| Quran memorization | High (personal) | Daily practice, start small |

---

## Integration Gaps

|----------|----------|-------------------|
| ClickUp | OpenClaw | ✅ Done (MCP bridge) |

## Summary

**Critical gaps:**
1. Video/image creation (blocking content production)
2. B2C marketing knowledge (blocking Oumafy/TheMuslimTake growth)
3. Master orchestrator (waiting on AI industry, 12-24 months)

**Quick to close:**
1. CRM → Use ClickUp
2. Islamic study → Start tomorrow, 15 mins
3. Finance tracking → Re-enable existing system

**Needs investment:**
1. Audio tools for TheMuslimTake
2. Video creation solution (learn or hire)
3. Marketing help (hire or partner)
