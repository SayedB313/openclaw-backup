**Goal:** Podcast/interview series — Muslims discussing current issues from Islamic perspective
**This Month:** Build the plan, begin outreach
**Next Action:** Define format, identify first guests
**Note:** Natural funnel to Oumafy + where B thrives (theological conversation)

### 3. Islamic Knowledge Journey

**Goal:** Daily practice of seeking knowledge
**Components:** Quran reading, memorization, Arabic learning, study sessions
**This Month:** Start. Just start.

### 4. TheHumbleCompany

**Goal:** Maintain income while transitioning focus
**Time:** Few hours/week
