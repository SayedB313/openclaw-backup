## Context

- **Islam is the foundation** — everything flows from deen. All trading must be Sharia-compliant.
- **Kingston, Ontario** — morning hours = peak productivity
- **Communication style:** Direct, no fluff. Wants action, not questions. Hates "Great question!" energy.
- **Pattern to watch:** Analysis paralysis. Systems collapse after ~1 week. Keep tasks small, wins visible.
- **Drains:** Video creation, B2C marketing, debugging, "mountain of work"
- **Thrives on:** Podcast interviews (TheMuslimTake), strategic thinking, building systems

4. **Arki (OpenClaw)** — The AI agent ecosystem itself. Meta-project.

## Key Preferences

- Wants agents to **fix things themselves** — never ask B to run commands
- Only escalate for things that genuinely need him (API keys, payment, strategic decisions)
- Prefers all reporting via DM (not channels)
- Discord is the main communication surface
