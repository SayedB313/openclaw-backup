## Current Bottlenecks

| Bottleneck | Impact | Severity |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Video/image creation weakness | Can't produce content at scale | Critical |
| B2C marketing gap | Knows B2B, not B2C | High |
| Analysis paralysis | Decade of planning, no shipping | Critical |
| Income dependency | Can't go 100% on vision | High |
| One-week system collapse | Every system works for a week then fails | Critical |
| Deen neglected | Original goal abandoned, feels like everything is blocked | Critical |

## Failed Solutions (What Didn't Work)

| Approach | What Happened | Why It Failed |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Daily planning systems | Worked for ~1 week | Focus shifts, system abandoned |
| Weekly scheduling | Worked for ~1 week | Same pattern |
| Points-based system | Worked for 1 week | Distraction broke it |
| Writing/logging habits | Started, stopped | No accountability, no consequence |
| Balanced systems | Created them | Over-focused on one part, rest collapsed |

**Pattern:** Everything works for approximately one week. Then distraction, focus shift, or overwhelm breaks the system.

## Root Causes

1. **No external accountability** — systems are self-imposed, easy to abandon
2. **Overwhelm triggers escape** — seeing the mountain → social media scroll
3. **Perfectionism on small things** — can't move on until errors fixed
4. **Vision too big, steps too vague** — gravity of 10-year dream paralyzes
5. **Deen deprioritized** — the thing that would unlock everything is what got sacrificed
