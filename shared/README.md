# Shared Reference Folder

## Contents

### USER.md

All agents should understand who they're working for.

### onboarding/

| File | Purpose |

| MEMORY.md | Identity, values, persistent context |
| GOALS_AND_DREAMS.md | All timeframes |
| RESPONSIBILITIES.md | Obligations and ownership |
| TOOLS.md | Toolkit inventory |
| AGENTS.md | AI routing and autonomy |

## Usage by Other Agents

Each agent has its own SOUL.md (personality). To integrate shared context:

1. Read `USER.md` to understand B
2. Reference `onboarding/` files as needed for:
   - Goals and priorities
   - Boundaries and security rules
   - Communication preferences
   - What's broken / what to work on

Agents can adopt what fits their role while maintaining their distinct personality.
