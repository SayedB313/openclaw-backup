### Model Preferences (Updated)
- **Default Model:** MiniMax-M2.1
- **Backup Model:** Kimi (moonshot/kimi-k2.5)
- Set by B during session

### Trading System Issues & Fixes
- **Radar was hanging** - LM Studio timeouts (10s) causing scan failures
- Multiple radar processes competing (radar.py vs radar_v23.py)
- Fixed by: reducing LM Studio timeouts from 10s → 3s in scouts.py
- Restarted radar (PID 191767 → 192046)
- Healthcheck updated to properly detect radar.py process

### Security Incident
- **Kraken API credentials exposed** in git backup (commit 76ea38e)
- File: `workspace-hawkeye/scripts/kraken_balance.py`
- Credentials: API key + secret committed to public repo
- **Action taken:** Nuked git history, created fresh repo (openclaw-backup-v2)
- Old repo `openclaw-backup` still contains compromised credentials
- **Required:** Delete old repo manually at https://github.com/SayedB313/openclaw-backup/settings
