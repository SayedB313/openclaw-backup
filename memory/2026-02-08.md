# 2026-02-08 — Day One (System Build-Out)

## What Happened

### Morning Session (massive infrastructure work)
1. **Git backup fixed** — switched gh from SSH to HTTPS, nuked git history (leaked secrets), force-pushed clean commit (130 files). Daily backup cron at 11 PM EST.

2. **Skills assigned to all agents** — clickup-mcp, twitter-x, email-himalaya. Per-agent (defaults schema doesn't support skills).

3. **Research Trader activated** — SOUL.md upgraded with trading frameworks. Heartbeat every 4h. First market scan posted to #research-trader: Gold ATH $4,961, Silver breakout $78.02, Silver trade idea (Long $75-78, stop $72, targets $82/$88-90).

4. **Logging consolidated** — Removed #logs channel from config. Main Agent owns all reporting via DM to B.

5. **Broken cron jobs cleaned** — Removed 3 Research Trader crons (wrong auth path). Fixed Arki Islamic Knowledge cron (MiniMax → Codex).

6. **Email set up** — Himalaya CLI + Gmail App Password. All agents have email-himalaya skill.

7. **Twitter/X skill built** — 
   - Installed Puppeteer + stealth plugin + system browser deps
   - twikit fails (Cloudflare blocks httpx TLS fingerprint)
   - ProxyEmpire residential proxy account created ($3.50/GB)
   - Puppeteer through proxy loads X pages successfully
   - Automated login fails (X anti-bot detection on form interaction)
   - **Solution:** B manually logged in on Mac Chrome, extracted cookies including HttpOnly auth_token
   - X scraping now works with cookies + proxy (verified: pulled @LaylaEleira tweets)

8. **Conductor retired** —
   - Absorbed all orchestration duties into Main Agent
   - Removed conductor from config (agents.list + bindings)
   - Updated all 7 agent SOULs (conductor → main-agent references)
   - Deleted #conductor Discord channel
   - Saved ORCHESTRATION.md to workspace

### System State at End of Day
- 8 agents (down from 9 — conductor removed)
- All agents have 3 skills: clickup-mcp, twitter-x, email-himalaya
- X scraping operational (Puppeteer + proxy + manual cookies)
- Email operational (Himalaya + Gmail)
- GitHub backup operational (daily cron)
- Main Agent = orchestrator + personal assistant + system admin

### Issues Remaining
- X cookie refresh: auth_token will expire eventually, B will need to re-extract
- Research Trader hallucinated fake @LaylaEleira data — Grok model too eager to please
- Some proxy IPs get "Something went wrong" from X (~50% hit rate)

### Lessons Learned
- `agents.defaults` does NOT support `skills` — must set per-agent
- MiniMax OAuth doesn't work in isolated cron sessions — always use codex
- twikit is useless for X scraping (httpx fingerprint = instant Cloudflare 403)
- X ties cookies to browser fingerprint, not IP — cookies from Mac Chrome work on server via proxy
- `page.type()` + Enter key works, but X React login detects automation via error banner
- ProxyEmpire `-sid-XXXX` suffix controls sticky sessions — change suffix for new IP
