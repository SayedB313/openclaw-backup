# GOALS_AND_DREAMS.md — Where This Is Going

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07

## The Endgame (Full Scale)

**10,000,000 members globally** in the Oumafy ecosystem.

- Self-sufficient decentralized economy
- Members are customers to other members' products/services
- Market-maker status within the ecosystem
- Collective prosperity, effort-based ownership

---

## 3-Year Vision (2029)

**1,000,000 members** in the ecosystem.

- Hundreds of millions in revenue flowing through the system
- Multiple businesses operating under Oumafy
- Community self-sustaining

## 2026 Targets

| Goal | Metric | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Community members | 1,000 | Not started |
| Revenue-generating businesses | ≥1 | Not started |
| Outbound system operational | Functional | Not started |
| TheMuslimTake launched | Episodes live | Planning |
| Islamic knowledge journey | Daily practice | Not started |

**Success = members + revenue + religious study active.**
**Failure = still in idea phase like 2014-2025.**

---

## This Month (February 2026)

1. **Outreach system operational** — content, UGC, clippers, email, or some combination. Getting the word out.
2. **Start dedicated Islamic knowledge journey** — daily practice, not someday.
3. **TheMuslimTake plan built** — concept solidified, outreach begun.

## Active vs Theoretical

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Oumafy ecosystem | Theoretical (concept, website exists, no traction) |
| TheMuslimTake | Theoretical (idea, no episodes) |
| TheHumbleCompany | Active (income, few hrs/week) |
| Islamic knowledge journey | Not started |
| Community building | Not started |

---

## Conflicts & Tensions

1. **Income vs Vision:** TheHumbleCompany pays bills but drains energy from Oumafy/TheMuslimTake.
2. **Deen vs Dunya:** Original goal was scholarship. Oumafy consumed that time. Now must integrate, not sacrifice.
3. **Analysis vs Execution:** Decade of planning, no shipping. Systems work for a week then collapse.

## Background Automations Needed

- [ ] Outbound content pipeline (reduces manual creation burden)
- [ ] Community onboarding flow (when members arrive)
- [ ] Islamic knowledge daily prompt/accountability
- [ ] TheMuslimTake guest outreach system
