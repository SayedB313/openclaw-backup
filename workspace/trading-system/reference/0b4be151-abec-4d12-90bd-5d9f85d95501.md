## INITIAL CONTEXT (Pre-Session Summary)

The conversation began with the user (B/Linx1001) requesting a deep dive into @LaylaEleira's X profile to find a complete trading setup. Previous attempts to scrape the profile via API had failed due to authentication issues.

**Key Context from Prior Session:**
- System hardening completed (sandbox=all, web tools denied)
- Twitter-X skill installed with proxy-agent fix
- X Developer credentials configured
- Proxy Empire working
- User confirmed: "she is the one who came up with it and is using some sort of setup similar to ours"

## SESSION TRANSCRIPT

### Phase 1: API Authentication Issues

**B:** "What happen to the tool I gave you - the x developer ai platform"

**Executor-500:** "You're referring to the X Developer API credentials. I have these from `~/.openclaw/.secrets/twitter.json` but I'm getting blocked: `{"title":"Client Forbidden","detail":"Sorry, official Twitter clients cannot use this API. Register your own."}` This means the credentials were created for an "official Twitter client" app which is blocked. Need credentials from your own developer app."

**B:** "1. X API v2"

**Executor-500:** "The Bearer Token format looks wrong... Real X Bearer Tokens don't have URL-encoded characters. Can you go to the Developer Console and copy the actual Bearer Token?"

**B:** "They should be working"

**Executor-500:** "All authentication methods returning 401. The credentials might be for a disabled app or need additional permissions."

**B:** [Provides new credentials via text]
"Consumer Key Copy gPEr41bdIqDSoyqguVQ58Ikt2 Secret Key Copy nJxVgC4laD7Cy8gi8xxuPdKCBYF8pgIysIBI3ZPtKarsXKRsEr Bearer Token Copy AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABbc7QEAAAAAnMPtK%2Bv6A7A7DG7x%2Fs76QGjB9g28k%3D3pJrOrcOyT0zzGatX2NxVxffmzQNxGDCB3C28MQN3TXDqU7TP2"

[Multiple authentication attempts - all returning 401/403]

**Executor-500:** "Still getting 401. The Bearer Token format is wrong - has URL-encoded characters."

**B:** "EXECUTOR 500 This app was created to use the X API. ACTIVE 32365590"

**Executor-500:** "Still 401 - token is URL-encoded. Need properly formatted Bearer Token."

### Phase 2: Chrome Browser Scraping Solution

**B:** "What about setting up browser access through chrome - and searching through that"

**Executor-500:** "Good idea! Let me set up proper Chrome browser access with stealth mode."
