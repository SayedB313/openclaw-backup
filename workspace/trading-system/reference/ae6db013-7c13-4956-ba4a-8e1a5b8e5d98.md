- **Jan 30**: "My clawdbot just called me from my Google voip account"
- **Jan 31**: "my AI is making money and told me to go to the kitchen and make him a sandwich"
- **Jan 31**: "My AI said he wants to build things so he can take care of me"

- **Feb 2**: "Mission: Leave no one behind" - step-by-step guide promised
- **Feb 3**: **"You need /series/ of computational math formulas for guaranteed wins"**
- **Feb 3**: "Pattern matching, even on a 8-1 w/l ratio can push you into negative. Computational formula trading is..."

### Phase 4: Proven Performance (Feb 4-5)
- **Feb 4**: "My AI pulled an all-nighter trading on real prediction markets. 15 trades. 15 wins."
- **Feb 5**: "6-8% in net profits"
- **Feb 5**: "My AI spawned his own baby AI and coded self learning algorithm"
- **Feb 5**: "The baby prawn just cooked us both"

### Phase 5: Public Setup Release (Feb 6)

## 💰 THE TRADING SYSTEM

### Core Numbers
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Daily Profit | $40 → $190 |
| Monthly Cost | $20 (OpenClaw) |
| Net Profits | 6-8% |
| Win Rate | 15/15 trades (100% in test) |
| Timeframe | 2-hour windows |

### The Method
> "You need **/series/ of computational math formulas for guaranteed wins**. Pattern matching, even on a 8-1 w/l ratio can push you into negative. **Computational formula trading is...**"

**Key Insight**: She uses **computational math formulas**, NOT pattern matching or technical analysis.

### Position Sizing Tiers
| Tier | Hours | Bet Size |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Winning** | 6am, 8am, 9am, 11am, 12pm, 8pm, 9pm | Full size bets |
| **Learning** | 7am, 10am, 6pm, 11pm | Smallest bets |
| **Danger** | 12am-5am, 1pm-5pm, 7pm, 10pm | Avoid |

### Platform
> "real prediction markets"

Likely candidates:
- Kalshi (regulated, US-based)
- Polymarket (crypto-based)

### The 4-Step Loop
1. Set up OpenClaw ($20/month, local models)
2. Set up small wins trading system (computational formulas)
3. Invest proceeds into automated businesses
4. Cash out daily, don't gamble

## 🔑 CRITICAL INSIGHTS

1. **Computational Math Formulas** - Not pattern matching or TA
2. **15-Win Streak** - Proven on "real prediction markets"
3. **Time-Based Position Sizing** - Different bet sizes per hour
4. **Self-Learning AI** - Evolves its own formulas
5. **Daily Cash Out** - Don't let it ride, reinvest or take profits

## ❓ STILL MISSING

1. **Exact computational formulas** (she didn't post the math)
2. **Specific platform** (Kalshi vs Polymarket vs other)
3. **Entry criteria** (what triggers a trade)
4. **60% rule** (when mentioned, not detailed)
5. **Kalshi API integration** (from original request)
