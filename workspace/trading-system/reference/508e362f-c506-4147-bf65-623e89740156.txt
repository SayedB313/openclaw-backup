System: Good. This is a clean separation:

WhatsApp (Assistant) = you ↔ assistant (deen, reminders, coaching, quick capture, light clarification)
Discord (Orchestrator / Chief Strategy) = the brain that runs the team
Discord (specialists) = doers

Here’s how the agents would actually work in practice (especially multi-step chains) without bothering you.

---

1) The “handoff” from WhatsApp → Orchestrator (simple template)
WhatsApp Assistant should not think deeply. It should only produce a tight intake packet like:

INTAKE PACKET
Goal: …
Constraints: budget/time/tools/haram boundaries/etc
Output format: doc / plan / code / posts
Deadline: …
Priority: low/med/high
Unknowns (max 3 questions): …

Then it forwards that to the Orchestrator in Discord.

---

2) How orchestration works (the core loop)
The Orchestrator runs a simple finite-state workflow per project:

A. Plan
Break goal into “work units” (tasks) with clear outputs + acceptance criteria.

B. Dispatch
Assign each work unit to the right specialist agent:
Research Associate → quick sourcing, breadth
Senior Research Analyst → depth, heavy synthesis
Lead Software Engineer → build/ship/repo work
Marketing Director → strategy, campaigns, content system

C. Collect
Specialists return results in their own Discord channels/threads.

D. Integrate
Orchestrator merges outputs into the final cohesive deliverable.

E. Decide Next Step (task chaining)
Based on what came back, it automatically creates the next task(s) and dispatches again.

This is how you get multi-step execution without you managing handoffs.

---
3) Multi-step example (task chaining)
You: “Build a marketing outbound + UGC content system.”

Step 1 (Research Associate)
Deliverable: examples, competitors, channel benchmarks, offers, hooks library starter.
Returns sources + bullet summary.

Step 2 (Marketing Director)
Uses Step 1 to produce:
positioning + offer
outbound sequence v1
UGC content machine (roles, prompts, cadence)
tracking metrics

Step 3 (Lead Software Engineer)
Builds infrastructure:
landing page / tracking sheet automation / ClickUp structure
templates + repo assets

Step 4 (Orchestrator)
Integrates everything into:
one “Operating System” doc
“Day 1 / Week 1” execution checklist
what needs your approval

If Step 2 reveals “we need a clearer niche,” the Orchestrator spawns a micro-task back to Research or asks you one targeted question. Otherwise it keeps chaining.

---

4) Where the work lives (so nothing gets lost)
To keep it robust, pick one canonical storage:

Best practice:
ClickUp = canonical record (task IDs, status, checklist, final links)
Discord = workshop (iterations + discussion)
GitHub = code assets (PRs/commits)
WhatsApp = you-only summaries (no heavy logs)

Even if Discord scrolls, the Orchestrator posts final deliverables back onto the ClickUp task.

---

5) “Don’t bother me unless emergency” — how to enforce that
The Orchestrator only pings you when:
a decision is required (approval / choose 1 of 2 directions)
blocked by missing info only you have
risk/security/cost issue
task is done and ready for your review (optional)

Everything else stays internal to Discord + ClickUp.
---

6) The big technical question: how do agents “send tasks” to each other?
There are three implementation patterns:

Pattern 1: ClickUp-native orchestration (most reliable)
Orchestrator creates/updates tasks in ClickUp and assigns them to “agents” (lists).
Specialists work off those tasks.
No cross-agent messaging required.

Pattern 2: Discord dispatch (fast)
Orchestrator posts a “TASK CARD” into a specialist’s channel.
Specialist replies with “DONE + deliverables”.
Orchestrator chains next tasks.

Pattern 3: Hybrid (recommended)
Orchestrator creates ClickUp tasks (canonical)
Also posts the Task Card in Discord (execution)
Updates ClickUp with final output links

This avoids the old “cron pull” fear because it’s push-based, not scheduled pulling.

---

Two design choices for you (quick)
1) Orchestrator model: you said Opus 4.6 — we can set it to opus46 when available, and fall back to opus (4.5) automatically.
2) Canonical store: ClickUp canonical (recommended) or Discord-only?

Answer those two and I’ll describe the exact channel layout + agent roster that matches it.
