### 💡 Philosophy

> "If it was easy - everyone would do it. It's not, but you know what else is hard? You're 9-5, spending your time and energy building things that don't fulfill you."

> "AI is not here to make you obsolete, it will break you out of your chains if you stay aligned."

### 🔑 Critical Gap

The **specific trading platform** and **entry criteria** are not explicitly stated in accessible tweets. The setup might be:
1. In a pinned tweet or thread not yet found
2. In the "nervous system code" repository (GitHub link not found)
3. In DMs or private communities

### Next Steps to Complete Setup
1. **Find the GitHub repo** for Kai's "nervous system code"
2. **Look for Kalshi integration** (mentioned in our MEMORY.md but source unclear)
3. **Reverse-engineer the 60% rule** from "11:88" in bio
4. **Test the time windows** with paper trading
