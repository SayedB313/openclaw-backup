### 3. ANALYZER - DeepSeek V3.2 API (Cloud)

**Role:** Combined Validator + Reasoner
**Innovation:** Merged two roles into one API call for efficiency

**Why Combined:**
- DeepSeek V3.2 is powerful enough for both
- One API call = lower latency than two separate
- Better context sharing (math informs reasoning, reasoning validates math)
- Simpler architecture
- Lower cost

**Validator Responsibilities:**
- Kelly Criterion calculations with full variables
- Expected Value (EV) analysis
- Probability distribution modeling
- Position sizing optimization
- Risk-adjusted return calculations

**Reasoner Responsibilities:**
- Narrative analysis of market conditions
- Sentiment interpretation (scout data → insights)
- Pattern recognition across historical trades
- Edge case detection (whale manipulation, black swans)
- Loss forensics (root cause analysis)
- Formula validation (review Baby AI mutations)

**Example Prompt to DeepSeek:**
```
You are the Analyzer for an AI trading system.

VALIDATOR TASK - Calculate:
1. Kelly Criterion optimal position size
2. Expected Value (EV) of this trade
3. Risk-adjusted return

REASONER TASK - Analyze:
1. Market sentiment and narrative
2. Historical pattern match (have we seen this setup before?)
3. Edge case risks (manipulation, black swan indicators)
4. Confidence score (0-1)

INPUT DATA:
- Market: Polymarket "Will BTC > $50k by Friday?"
- Current price: 0.48 (48% odds)
- Scout sentiment: +0.72 (bullish)
- Historical win rate (Fri 8pm): 82%
- Portfolio: $318.40
- Hour tier: Winning (can use 15% max)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "validator": {
    "kelly_fraction": 0.12,
    "position_size_usd": 38.21,
    "ev_percent": 18.5,
    "risk_reward_ratio": 3.2
  },
  "reasoner": {
    "sentiment_analysis": "Bullish momentum...",
    "pattern_match": "Similar to Trade #47 (won)",
    "edge_cases": ["Whale moved $12M"],
    "confidence": 0.81,
    "recommendation": "EXECUTE"
  }
}
```

**Latency:** ~1.5 seconds (acceptable for 20% of trades)
**Cost:** Very low (DeepSeek pricing is competitive)
**When called:** Only when Executor-500 confidence < 70% or position > $30

---

- Baby AI spawn approval (before deploying new formulas live)
- Loss analysis deep dives ("Why did we really lose this trade?")
- Risk limit changes (approve increasing daily risk from 2% to 3%?)

**Activation:**
- Manual trigger by you (B)
- Automatic trigger: 3 consecutive losses
- Automatic trigger: Daily loss > $10
- Automatic trigger: System detects "unknown unknown"

**Not involved in:**
- Routine trades (handled by Executor-500 + DeepSeek)
- Scout monitoring (fully automated)
- Standard position sizing (math is math)

## 📊 TRADING STRATEGY: 60% RESONANCE LOOP

### Core Philosophy

> *"Computational math formulas, not pattern matching. Small calculated wins stacked, not gambling."*
> — @LaylaEleira

### The 4 Phases

#### Phase 1: SCAN (0-60% of event window)
**Who:** Scout Swarm (24/7)
**What:** 
- Monitor all prediction markets
- Collect real-time data (price, volume, sentiment)
- Track 60% time progression
**Output:** Raw data stream to Executor-500

#### Phase 2: CALCULATE (60% mark)
**Who:** Executor-500 (fast) → DeepSeek V3.2 (if complex)
**What:**
- Calculate Real_Probability from multiple sources
- Compare to Market_Price
- Generate Dissonance Score = |Real - Market|
**Decision Point:** 
- If Dissonance < 30% → SKIP (insufficient edge)
- If Dissonance > 30% → Continue to Phase 3

#### Phase 3: VALIDATE & REASON (60% + Dissonance confirmed)
**Who:** DeepSeek V3.2 (combined Validator + Reasoner)
**What:**
- Kelly Criterion position sizing
- EV calculation
- Risk analysis
- Edge case detection
**Output:** GO/NO-GO recommendation with full reasoning

#### Phase 4: EXECUTE (2-hour cycles)
**Who:** Executor-500 → Polymarket API
**What:**
- Place trade
- Set stop-loss (2% max loss)
- Set take-profit (6% target)
- Monitor for 2 hours
**Post-Trade:**
- Cash out (win or loss)
- Log to trade-journal
- Withdraw daily profits
- Reset for next day

### Time Windows (EST)

| Tier | Hours | Position Size | Rationale |
|------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **WINNING** | 6am, 8am, 9am, 11am, 12pm, 8pm, 9pm | 10-15% (full size) | High liquidity, proven edge |
| **LEARNING** | 7am, 10am, 6pm, 11pm | 2-5% (small) | Testing new patterns |
| **DANGER** | 12am-5am, 1pm-5pm, 7pm, 10pm | 0% (AVOID) | Low liquidity, manipulation risk |

### Mathematical Formulas

**1. 60% Time Rule:**
```
If (Time_Elapsed / Total_Event_Duration) > 0.60:
    If (Real_World_Certainty > 0.80) AND (Market_Price < 0.50):
        Proceed_to_Analysis()
```

**2. Dissonance Score:**
```
Dissonance = |Real_Probability - Market_Price|
If Dissonance > 0.30:  // 30% gap = edge
    High_Conviction_Trade()
```

**3. Kelly Criterion (Position Sizing):**
```
f* = (p × b - q) / b

Where:
p = win probability (from historical hour data)
q = loss probability (1 - p)
b = average win / average loss (typically 3:1)

Hour Adjustments:
- Winning hours: max f = 0.15 (15% of portfolio)
- Learning hours: max f = 0.05 (5% of portfolio)
- Danger hours: f = 0 (no trade)
```

**4. Expected Value:**
```
EV = (Win_Probability × Win_Amount) - (Loss_Probability × Loss_Amount)
Minimum Threshold: EV > 0.15 (15% expected edge)
```

**5. Real Probability (Multi-Source):**
```
Real_Prob = (
    Market_Price × 0.40 +           // Base
    Twitter_Sentiment × 0.25 +      // Social signal
    News_Sentiment × 0.25 +         // Informational edge
    OnChain_Signal × 0.10           // Whale activity
)
```

| **TOTAL** | **~$50-55** | **~$600-660** |

### ROI Analysis

**Conservative (6% daily, $40 start, scale over 6 months):**
- Month 1-2: $40 → $80 (compound)
- Month 3-4: $80 → $160
- Month 5-6: $160 → $320
- **6-month profit:** ~$1,200
- **ROI:** 200% (after costs)

**Optimistic (reach $190/day target):**
- **Annual profit:** $68,400
- **Annual costs:** $660
- **Net:** $67,740
- **ROI:** 10,000%+

**Reality check:** Will likely be between conservative and optimistic. Plan for 6-month validation period.

## ⚠️ RISK MANAGEMENT

### Daily Limits (Hard Stops)

| Risk Type | Limit | Action When Hit |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Daily Loss** | 2% of portfolio | STOP all trading for 24h |
| **Single Position** | 15% max (10% normal) | Hard cap, never exceed |
| **Consecutive Losses** | 3 in a row | Pause, review formulas, alert Claude |
| **Daily Profit** | Target $190 | Withdraw, restart fresh |
| **Weekly Loss** | 5% of portfolio | Full system audit, manual review |

### Conscience Layer Checks

**Before EVERY trade:**
1. ✅ Is current hour in Winning/Learning tier? (Not Danger)
2. ✅ Has 60% of window elapsed?
3. ✅ Is Dissonance > 30%?
4. ✅ Is confidence > 70%?
5. ✅ Is daily risk < 2% so far?
6. ✅ Is this trade "calculated" not "gambling"?

**If ANY check fails:** NO TRADE

### Baby AI Safeguards

**Formula Evolution Rules:**
- New formulas start in LEARNING hours only (2-5% positions)
- 20-trade minimum before promotion
- Must achieve >70% win rate to move to Winning hours
- Any formula with <60% win rate after 20 trades → RETIRED
- Claude approval required for formula spawning
